# VRelaxScape
Graduation Project

This was my graduation project that I made for Viemr. The intent was to create and reason if VR was an applicable, meaningful and an appropreate means for inducing relaxation in users.

The project was developed for to run on an Oculus Go and developed in Unity 2018.3.x

My graduation Thesis can also be found in this repository + the source code to compile within Unity and run the project.
